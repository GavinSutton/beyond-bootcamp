Hey! 

Welcome to my Tennyson Wolf Jukebox project. Right now, it's currently under construction. 

If you weren't aware, I make music under the moniker Tennyson Wolf. You can find me wherever you stream music, but I thought it would be fun to make my own site for streaming my music based on moods, genres, my own personalized playlists, and more, with the added bonus of lyrics at hand and album art with all the credits to the wonderful people who have helped me on this musical journey. 

Feel free to check my progress or come back later when it's all finished!
